# Hashmap

A simple implementation of a hashmap data structure in Javascript. This project helped me practice understanding hash functions, collision handling, and efficient data retrieval. It includes basic operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup, along with test cases to verify functionality.

## Getting Started

Before getting started make sure you have the latest version of npm installed.

I recommend downloading Node Version Manager (NVM) first and then downloading Node.
